 (1)       < what is s3? > 
s3 is the object storage service which provide secure, sclable and durable way to store object in s3.
In a DevOps environment, S3 is used for storing application artifacts, backups, logs, and as a source for deploying code and assets.

  (2) Explain the concept of S3 buckets and objects. How is data organized in S3?
 S3 uses a flat namespace where data is organized into buckets, which are top-level containers for storing objects. Objects are the actual data files stored within buckets and can range from small files to large data sets.

buccket means ---> it is like container where we can store our data.
object -----> object means actual data into buccket.


 (3)  what are the storage classes in s3?
storage clasess are we use basically for reduce cost.
s3 provide various ways to store data in s3
-- first standard classs --it costest storage class in s3 we use for frequently access data.
-- another is s3 standard infrequent --> where we use for infrequently access data.
-- s3 intelligent tireing - we s3 it automatically move data according to use.
suppose your data in standard class but you dont access it frequently it will move your data automatically into -- infrequent. if your basiclly it move data according to use.
-- s3 glacerr class
--deep archive - if we dont access our data from more than 180 days it will move data in deep arcchive.
 
 (4)  How can you secure data in S3 buckets, and what are the best practices for implementing data access controls
  -- using buccet policies and access control list.
  -- enabling i am polices and roles.
  -- MFA using .

  (5) what is the corss region replication and how it help us in diaster recover.
  -- cross region replication allow to us to replicate data one region to diffrent region.
  -- if our one serevr  goes down. another region data available for us.
  -- it will reduce redudency.

  (6) explain what is access control list and s3 buccket policies.
  -- acl and s3 buccet policies provide us to grant permisions allow or deny to our s3 r
