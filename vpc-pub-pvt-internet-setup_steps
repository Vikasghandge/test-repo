suppose you have a data into your private instance and you want to access it which dont have any public ip to
access. and now you got an task to provide a internet that pvt server.
first of all go into vpc and click to create vpc -----> it will create vpc name the vpc <my_project-vpc> 
then you need to give cidr ip range for vpc 
10.0.0.0/16   CIDR ip range  click to create vpc.
now you need to create subnets for your servers.
go into subnets then crate subnet 
public subnet  ip range CIDR 10.0.0.0/24  -----> it will lock ranges
private subnet ip range CIDR 10.0.1.0/24  ----->  same
after you successfully created pub and pvt subnet you need to create pub and pvt route table.
create public route table  ---> for public ypu need to create internet gateway.
create privet route table  ---> for private you need to create nat gateway.
go into internate gatway name the gateway ex. <igw-projetc> create it and attach it to vpc
go into nat gateway create nat gateway ex. <my-natgateway>.
now you need to make sure your natgateway should be in public subnet. thats why choose public subnet.
now come to back in route table.
select public route table --> go into edit route ---> then select intergate ---> then subnet accositation select public subnet.
now come in pvt route table
edit route ----> then select nat-gatway---> then subnet association select private subnet.
make sure elastic ip associated.
your setup is now ready.
