## HOW TO SETUP WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL (WAF).
FIRST STEP WE NEED VPC (CREATE VPC, CREATE PUBLIC SUBNET, THEN CREATE ROUTE TABLE, ADD IGW TO ROUTE TABLE AND ASSOCIATE PUBLIC SUBNET THEN CREATE VPC)
NOW WE NEED TO CREATE SERVER IN OUR CUSTOM VPC.
GO TO AWS EC2 CONSOLE.
CREATE INSTANCE NAME: WAF-TEST
IMAGE: UBUNTU
NETWORK: SELECT OUR CUSTOM VPC.
SUBNET: PUBLIC
IP: PUBLIC ENABLED
KEY: YOUR KEY
THEN GO TO ADDVANCE SETTING.
ADD USER CONTENT LIKE THIS
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hi This Is Vicky Testing WAF" >> /var/www/html

```
LAUNCH SERVER ALLOW SSH AND HTTP PROTOCOL.
ACCESS SERVER ON http://192.168.32.0:80

### NOW WE NEED TO CREATE  TARGET GROUP AND LOADBALANCER.
GO TO TARGET GROUPS NAME THE GROUPS LIKE NAME: WAF-TARGET-GP TYPE: INSTANCES AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHOOSING OUR CREATE CUSTOM VPC.
THEN CREATE TARGET GROUP IN TARGET ADD OUR SEVRER WHICH WE HAVE CREATED IN CUSTOM VPC.
NOW WE NEED TO CREATE LOAD BALACNER GO TO LOADBALANCER CHOOSE TYPE OF APPLICATION LOADBALCNER LIKE APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER AND CREATE NAME: MY-WAF-LB
IT SHOULD BE INTERNET FACING 
SELECT IP TYPE IPV4
VPC = CUSTOM VPC

THEN SELECT LISTENING AND ROUTING.
ADD OUR TARGET GROUP WHICH WE HAVE CREATED. LIKE WAF-TARGET-GP NOW NOW OTHER THINGS DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE AND CREATE AND LAUNCH LOAD BALANCER.
ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION BY USING LOADBALCNER DNS URL:

### WAF CREATEION
